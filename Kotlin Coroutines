What is Coroutine?
Its a feature in Kotlin that helps us writing asynchronous code in simplified and readable manner.
It makes writing async code simpler than ever.
or
A couroutine is a concurrency design pattern that you can use on android to simplify code that executes asynchronously.

-------------------------------

suspend Modifier
suspend -> means this functions can suspend and start.
we add this to our function.... suspend basically mean that this function needs coroutine to execute. we can't call suspend function directly.

suspend fun fetchDataFromNetwork() {
   val result = networkRequest()
   updateUI(result)
}

it looks like synchronous... but it is asynchronous

----------------------------------------

Issue with old one
scenario : we need to call three apis sequentially. then code structure would be get complex

call1.enqueue(
   response1 -> call2.enqueue(
      response2 -> call3.enqueue(
         response3 -> 
      )
   )
)
//nested callbacks..... :(

lets convert it to synchronous looking code

for using coroutines with retrofit... min version of retrofit should be 2.6 .
add "suspend" to function in api interface whom you need to use through coroutine
and change return type from Callback<T> to Response<T>
